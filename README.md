This project using Carbo module management.

## Warning

If you didn't set rustup to nightly you need to do:

```shell
rustup override set nightly
```

## run project

```shell
cargo build --release
```

```shell
cargo run
```

With watch

```shell
cargo watch -x run
```

Watch chages in only the src folder use:

```shell
cargo watch -c -w src -x run
```
